# Anomaly-detection-with-K-means
This is a scratch code implementing image segmentation and anomaly detection using one of the most esteemed clustering methods in Image processing and machine Learning, K-Means Clustering. 

This code has numerous improvement scopes when using methods defined in esteemed papers and jornals modifying the classical algorithm.
As all the k-means usage functions are built from scratch they can be modified to suit thr needs of the specific image to be segemnted.

** I found the images on another user's githup repo. But I sadly dont remember which one. So if you find this and the collecton of images belong to you, feel free to ask for credits for the same.

If you like the project please give a star. If you are feeling very generous leave a Follow as well.
