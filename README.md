# Anomaly-detection-with-K-means
This is a scratch code implementing image segmentation and anomaly detection using one of the most esteemed clustering methods in Image processing and machine Learning, K-Means Clustering. 

This code has numerous improvement scopes when using methods defined in esteemed papers and jornals modifying the classical algorithm.
As all the k-means usage functions are built from scratch they can be modified to suit thr needs of the specific image to be segemnted.
